# TASK - 5 Advertising Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìò Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts **sales revenue** based on advertising expenditure across various media channels such as **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**.  
This project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can optimize marketing budgets for maximum return on investment.

## üß© Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Loading**
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`.
- Inspected the structure, shape, and summary statistics.
- Checked for null values, data types, and distribution of each feature.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized the relationship between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales.
- Created **pair plots**, **heatmaps**, and **scatter plots** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Identified that **TV advertising** shows the strongest correlation with sales.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split`.
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.
- Created preprocessing pipelines using `make_pipeline` and `make_column_transformer` for modularity.

### 4. **Model Building**
- Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict sales.
- Trained the model using the training dataset.
- Tuned model parameters for optimal performance.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **R¬≤ Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- Visualized predicted vs actual sales for better interpretability.

### 6. **Model Saving**
- Saved the trained model using `pickle` for future deployment.
- Enabled easy reusability without retraining.
